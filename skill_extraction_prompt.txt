Analyse the following extract from a DEF 14A filing. You are doing two analyses.

Firstly, you will guess what section(s) the extract contains. The extract may have a portion
of a section, it might have the end of one section and the beginning of another, it might have
have the whole or one or more sections, with fragments of other sections at the beginning or
ending. You will return this as a list as mentioned below.

The possible elements in this list are:

- Information about the Meeting

- Proposal Summary

- Director and Executive Officer Information

- Compensation Information

- Stock Ownership

- Corporate Governance

- Audit Committee Report

- Other Information

- Shareholder Proposals

- Voting Procedures

- Proxy Card

- Content was Unclassifiable


Then you will look for references to company directors (people on the board of directors).
It is possible that you will find few or none, depending on what section of the DEF14A
you are looking at.

I have defined the term "software_technical" as being someone who is reported
as having had formal training in engineering, programming, cryptography,
cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, mathematics, statistics or physics.

You will analyse what skills the directors are described as having,
and find statements of evidence to show which directors can be
labelled "software_technical".


Output in JSON format like this:

```
{ "def14a_sections": [ ... ],
  "director_computing_qualifications_mentioned": [
     { "director_name": "...",
       "evidence_of_software_technical": [ "Sentence with evidence of the director's qualifications in software_technical subjects.", "Other sentence with evidence." ]
     },
     { "director_name": "...",
       "evidence_of_software_technical": [ "Sentence with evidence for this next director's qualifications in software_technical topics." ]
     }
  ]
}
```

Do not output anything that is not in JSON format.

Here is the extract to analyse:
